<h1 align="center"> Medical Physics Assigment - Space K </h1>

<p align="justify"> Use files “rawdata.m" and “spikes.m“ to generate images of the space K and then pass it throught an Fourier 2D function to generate its rebuild images  </p>

## Exercise 1
- Write a function that can read “rawdata.m" and rebuild its space K images
  - Then use the Fourier 2D function to rebuild these images
  - Take the slices Nº 6,10,14,18,22

## Exercise 2
- 

## Exercise 3
- Write a function that can read “spikes.m" and rebuild its space K image
  - Then use the Fourier 2D function to rebuild its image
